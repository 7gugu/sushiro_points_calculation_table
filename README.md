之所以想要开发这个快查表，单纯是因为我喜欢吃回转寿司，吃了75次寿司，吃够了积分，兑换到了心心念念的寿司郎联名多美卡的火车玩具。但是复盘了一下，目前的积分额度计算太模糊了，我也不知道自己吃了多少钱的寿司才兑换到这个玩具，所以临时起意，写了这个快查表出来，方便复盘。

The reason why I want to develop this quick check table is simply because I like to eat conveyor belt sushi. I ate sushi 75 times and earned enough points to exchange for the convenient train toy that I had always dreamed of, Sushiro and Tomica. But after reviewing it, the current point calculation is too vague, and I don’t know how much sushi I ate to exchange for this toy, so I suddenly came up with this quick check table and reviewed it.
